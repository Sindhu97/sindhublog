Hello Beautiful People,
  As a broke and stressed NYU student stuck in the hustle and bustle of NYC, usually I find myself forgetting to swipe to get past a subway turnstile, falling asleep on the F train and missing my stop, waiting to watch (and snapchat) the street dancers in Times Square, running to an 8am class in Brooklyn with sweatpants and a dollar coffee and then straight to work, struggling to run a C++ program at 1am, and surviving on take-out or Chipotle for weeks.

  But when I’m not trying hella hard to get my life together, I’m lucky to find some time for myself. I find joy in pretending to sing like Beyonce in the shower, making lip-sync videos, writing about situations that I know will never happen, trying to awkwardly combine classical Indian dance with the Milly Rock, or simply feeling like a photographer every time I take an Instagram-worthy picture of things that are aesthetically pleasing. Every day, I’m just trying to tap into my inner creative self and this is just an attempt to share what makes me happy, with the world.
